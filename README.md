A node-based AI workflow system for configuring and running AI Agents using LLMs. The **AI Workflow System** is a node-based workflow where users can create and connect **User Input Nodes, Model Nodes, and Response Nodes** to configure and run an AI Agent powered by a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

## Features

- **Dynamic Node Creation** - Users can create and connect multiple nodes dynamically.
- **Caching Model Configurations** - Stores model configurations on deployment for continuous conversations.
- **Undeploying Workflows** - Cleans up model configurations and context data when undeployed.
- **Context-Based Chat Feature** - Supports follow-up questions with conversation history limits.

## Key Components

- **User Input Node** - Captures user prompts.
- **Model Node** - Configures LLM parameters like model name, API key, temperature, etc.
- **Response Node** - Displays AI-generated responses.
- **Workflow Context** - Centralized state management for data consistency.

## Interaction Flow

1. Users input a prompt via the **User Input Node**.
2. The prompt flows to the **Model Node**, applying LLM configurations.
3. Processed data moves to the **Response Node**, displaying AI-generated responses.
4. The **Workflow Context** manages state transitions and context-based interactions.
